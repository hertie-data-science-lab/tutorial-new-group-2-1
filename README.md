## Tutorial for Sentinel-1 Flood Analysis: Transfer Learning and Embedding Applications  
**GRAD-E1394 Deep Learning – Assignment 3**

This tutorial introduces a practical workflow for **flood detection using Sentinel-1 satellite imagery**. It focuses on applying **transfer learning with pretrained convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to radar data in order to generate flood maps. The notebook combines conceptual explanations with practical implementation, highlighting how how transfer learning and embedding applications can support rapid flood monitoring and climate-related decision-making.

The tutorial demonstrates how Sentinel-1 radar data (VV and VH polarizations) can be applied to detect open-water flooding and flooded vegetation, and shows how learned embeddings can be used for downstream tasks such as classification, similarity search and clustering.

In addition to the tutorial notebook, we also provide a [slide presentation](https://github.com/hertie-data-science-lab/tutorial-new-group-2-1/blob/main/DL%20Presentation%202025%20-%20Group%202%20(final).pdf) that covers the relevance of the topic for public policy and government, as well as a quick background and overview of what is covered in the tutorial.

This video guide walks through the tutorial and its components to assist with the overall understanding of how to run the notebook.
